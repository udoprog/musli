//!
//! Excellent performance, no compromises[^1]!
//!
//! Müsli is a flexible, fast, and generic binary serialization framework for
//! Rust, in the same vein as [`serde`].
//!
//! It provides a set of [formats](#formats), each with its own well-documented
//! set of features and tradeoffs. Every byte-oriented serialization method
//! (including [`musli-json`]) has full `#[no_std]` support with or without
//! `alloc`. And a particularly neat component providing low-level refreshingly
//! simple [zero-copy serialization].
//!
//! [^1]: As in Müsli should be able to do everything you need and more.
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! ## Quick guide
//!
//! * For information on how to implement [`Encode`] and [`Decode`], see
//!   [`derives`].
//! * For information on how this library is tested, see [`tests`].
//! * For [performance] and [size comparisons].
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` using the [format](#formats) you want
//! to use:
//!
//! ```toml
//! musli = "0.0.97"
//! musli-wire = "0.0.97"
//! ```
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! The heavy lifting in user code is done through the [`Encode`] and [`Decode`]
//! derives which are thoroughly documented in the [`derives`] module. Müsli
//! primarily operates based on the schema types which implement these traits
//! imply, but self-descriptive formats are also possible (see
//! [`Formats`](#formats) below).
//!
//! ```
//! use musli::{Encode, Decode};
//!
//! #[derive(Encode, Decode)]
//! struct Person {
//!     /* .. fields .. */
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! > **Note** by default a field is identified by its *numerical index* which
//! > would change if they are re-ordered. Renaming fields and setting a default
//! > naming policy can be done by configuring the [`derives`].
//!
//! The binary serialization formats provided aim to efficiently and accurately
//! encode every type and data structure available in Rust. Each format comes
//! with [well-documented tradeoffs](#formats) and aim to be fully memory safe
//! to use.
//!
//! Internally we use the terms "encoding", "encode", and "decode" because it's
//! distinct from [`serde`]'s use of "serialization", "serialize", and
//! "deserialize" allowing for the ease of using both libraries side by side if
//! desired.
//!
//! Müsli is designed on similar principles as [`serde`]. Relying on Rust's
//! powerful trait system to generate code which can largely be optimized away.
//! The end result should be very similar to handwritten highly optimized code.
//!
//! As an example of this, these two functions both produce the same assembly on
//! my machine (built with `--release`):
//!
//! ```ignore
//! # use musli::{Decode, Encode};
//! # use musli::mode::DefaultMode;
//! # use musli_storage::encoding::Encoding;
//! # use musli_storage::options::{self, Options, Integer, ByteOrder};
//! # type Result<T, E = musli_storage::Error> = core::result::Result<T, E>;
//! const OPTIONS: Options = options::new()
//!     .with_integer(Integer::Fixed)
//!     .with_byte_order(ByteOrder::NATIVE)
//!     .build();
//!
//! const ENCODING: Encoding<DefaultMode, OPTIONS> = Encoding::new().with_options();
//!
//! #[derive(Encode, Decode)]
//! #[musli(packed)]
//! pub struct Storage {
//!     left: u32,
//!     right: u32,
//! }
//!
//! fn with_musli(storage: &Storage) -> Result<[u8; 8]> {
//!     let mut array = [0; 8];
//!     ENCODING.encode(&mut array[..], storage)?;
//!     Ok(array)
//! }
//!
//! fn without_musli(storage: &Storage) -> Result<[u8; 8]> {
//!     let mut array = [0; 8];
//!     array[..4].copy_from_slice(&storage.left.to_ne_bytes());
//!     array[4..].copy_from_slice(&storage.right.to_ne_bytes());
//!     Ok(array)
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Where Müsli differs in design philosophy is twofold:
//!
//! We make use of GATs to provide tighter abstractions, which should be easier
//! for Rust to optimize.
//!
//! We make less use of the Visitor pattern in certain instances where it's
//! deemed unnecessary, such as [when decoding collections]. The result is
//! usually cleaner decode implementations, as shown here:
//!
//! ```
//! use musli::Context;
//! use musli::de::{Decode, Decoder, SequenceDecoder};
//!
//! struct MyType {
//!     data: Vec<String>,
//! }
//!
//! impl<'de, M> Decode<'de, M> for MyType {
//!     fn decode<C, D>(cx: &C, decoder: D) -> Result<Self, C::Error>
//!     where
//!         C: ?Sized + Context<Mode = M>,
//!         D: Decoder<'de, C>,
//!     {
//!         let mut seq = decoder.decode_sequence(cx)?;
//!         let mut data = Vec::with_capacity(seq.size_hint(cx).or_default());
//!
//!         while let Some(decoder) = seq.decode_next(cx)? {
//!             data.push(cx.decode(decoder)?);
//!         }
//!
//!         seq.end(cx)?;
//!
//!         Ok(Self {
//!             data
//!         })
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Another major aspect where Müsli differs is in the concept of
//! [modes](#modes) (note the `M` parameter above). Since this is a parameter of
//! the `Encode` and `Decode` traits it allows for the same data model to be
//! serialized in many different ways. This is a larger topic and is covered
//! further down.
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! ## Formats
//!
//! Formats are currently distinguished by supporting various degrees of
//! *upgrade stability*. A fully upgrade stable encoding format must tolerate
//! that one model can add fields that an older version of the model should be
//! capable of ignoring.
//!
//! Partial upgrade stability can still be useful as is the case of the
//! *musli-storage* format below, because reading from storage only requires
//! decoding to be upgrade stable. So if correctly managed with
//! `#[musli(default)]` this will never result in any readers seeing unknown
//! fields.
//!
//! The available formats and their capabilities are:
//!
//! | | `reorder` | `missing` | `unknown` | `self` |
//! |-|-|-|-|-|
//! | [`musli-storage`] `#[musli(packed)]` | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
//! | [`musli-storage`]                    | ✔ | ✔ | ✗ | ✗ |
//! | [`musli-wire`]                       | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✗ |
//! | [`musli-descriptive`]                | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
//! | [`musli-json`][`musli-json`][^json]  | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
//!
//! `reorder` determines whether fields must occur in exactly the order in which
//! they are specified in their type. Reordering fields in such a type would
//! cause unknown but safe behavior of some kind. This is only suitable for
//! byte-oriented IPC where the data models of each client are are strictly
//! synchronized.
//!
//! `missing` determines if reading can handle missing fields through something
//! like `Option<T>`. This is suitable for on-disk storage, because it means
//! that new optional fields can be added as the schema evolves.
//!
//! `unknown` determines if the format can skip over unknown fields. This is
//! suitable for network communication. At this point you've reached *upgrade
//! stability*. Some level of introspection is possible here, because the
//! serialized format must contain enough information about fields to know what
//! to skip which usually allows for reasoning about basic types.
//!
//! `self` determines if the format is self-descriptive. Allowing the structure
//! of the data to be fully reconstructed from its serialized state. These
//! formats do not require models to decode, and can be converted to and from
//! dynamic containers such as [`musli-value`] for introspection.
//!
//! For every feature you drop, the format becomes more compact and efficient.
//! [`musli-storage`] using `#[musli(packed)]` for example is roughly as compact
//! as [`bincode`] while [`musli-wire`] is comparable in size to something like
//! [`protobuf`]. All formats are primarily byte-oriented, but some might
//! perform [bit packing] if the benefits are obvious.
//!
//! [^json]: This is strictly not a binary serialization, but it was implemented
//! as a litmus test to ensure that Müsli has the necessary framework features
//! to support it. Luckily, the implementation is also quite good!
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! ## Upgrade stability
//!
//! The following is an example of *full upgrade stability* using
//! [`musli-wire`]. Note how `Version1` can be decoded from an instance of
//! `Version2` because it understands how to skip fields which are part of
//! `Version2`. We're also explicitly `#[musli(rename = ..)]` the fields to
//! ensure that they don't change in case they are re-ordered.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use musli::{Encode, Decode};
//!
//! #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Encode, Decode)]
//! struct Version1 {
//!     #[musli(rename = 0)]
//!     name: String,
//! }
//!
//! #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Encode, Decode)]
//! struct Version2 {
//!     #[musli(rename = 0)]
//!     name: String,
//!     #[musli(default, rename = 1)]
//!     age: Option<u32>,
//! }
//!
//! let version2 = musli_wire::to_vec(&Version2 {
//!     name: String::from("Aristotle"),
//!     age: Some(62),
//! })?;
//!
//! let version1: Version1 = musli_wire::decode(version2.as_slice())?;
//! ```
//!
//! The following is an example of *partial upgrade stability* using
//! [`musli-storage`] on the same data models. Note how `Version2` can be
//! decoded from `Version1` but *not* the other way around. That's why it's
//! suitable for on-disk storage the schema can evolve from older to newer
//! versions.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! # use musli::{Encode, Decode};
//! # #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Encode, Decode)]
//! # struct Version1 { name: String }
//! # #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Encode, Decode)]
//! # struct Version2 { name: String, #[musli(default)] age: Option<u32> }
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let version2 = musli_storage::to_vec(&Version2 {
//!     name: String::from("Aristotle"),
//!     age: Some(62),
//! })?;
//!
//! assert!(musli_storage::decode::<_, Version1>(version2.as_slice()).is_err());
//!
//! let version1 = musli_storage::to_vec(&Version1 {
//!     name: String::from("Aristotle"),
//! })?;
//!
//! let version2: Version2 = musli_storage::decode(version1.as_slice())?;
//! # Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! ## Modes
//!
//! In Müsli the same model can be serialized in different ways. Instead of
//! requiring the use of distinct models we support implementing different
//! *modes* for a single model.
//!
//! A mode allows for different encoding attributes to apply depending on which
//! mode an encoder is configured to use. A mode can apply to *any* musli
//! parameter giving you a lot of flexibility.
//!
//! If a mode is not specified, an implementation will apply to all modes (`M:
//! Mode`), if at least one mode is specified it will be implemented for all
//! modes which are present in a model and [`DefaultMode`]. This way, an
//! encoding which uses `DefaultMode` (which it does by default) should always
//! work.
//!
//! For more information on how to configure modes, see the [`derives`] module.
//! Below is a simple example of how we can use two modes to provide two
//! different kinds of serialization to a single struct.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use musli::mode::DefaultMode;
//! use musli::{Decode, Encode};
//! use musli_json::Encoding;
//!
//! enum Alt {}
//!
//! #[derive(Decode, Encode)]
//! #[musli(mode = Alt, packed)]
//! #[musli(default_field = "name")]
//! struct Word<'a> {
//!     text: &'a str,
//!     teineigo: bool,
//! }
//!
//! const CONFIG: Encoding<DefaultMode> = Encoding::new();
//! const ALT_CONFIG: Encoding<Alt> = Encoding::new().with_mode();
//!
//! let word = Word {
//!     text: "あります",
//!     teineigo: true,
//! };
//!
//! let out = CONFIG.to_string(&word)?;
//! assert_eq!(out, r#"{"text":"あります","teineigo":true}"#);
//!
//! let out = ALT_CONFIG.to_string(&word)?;
//! assert_eq!(out, r#"["あります",true]"#);
//! ```
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! ## Unsafety
//!
//! This is a non-exhaustive list of unsafe use in this crate, and why they are
//! used:
//!
//! * A `mem::transcode` in `Tag::kind`. Which guarantees that converting into
//!   the `Kind` enum which is `#[repr(u8)]` is as efficient as possible.
//!
//! * A largely unsafe `SliceReader` which provides more efficient reading than
//!   the default `Reader` impl for `&[u8]` does. Since it can perform most of
//!   the necessary comparisons directly on the pointers.
//!
//! * Some unsafety related to UTF-8 handling in `musli_json`, because we check
//!   UTF-8 validity internally ourselves (like `serde_json`).
//!
//! * `FixedBytes<N>` is a stack-based container that can operate over
//!   uninitialized data. Its implementation is largely unsafe. With it
//!   stack-based serialization can be performed which is useful in no-std
//!   environments.
//!
//! * Some unsafe is used for owned `String` decoding in all binary formats to
//!   support faster string processing using [`simdutf8`]. Disabling the
//!   `simdutf8` feature (enabled by default) removes the use of this unsafe.
//!
//! To ensure this library is correctly implemented with regards to memory
//! safety, extensive testing is performed using `miri`. See [`tests`] for more
//! information on this.
